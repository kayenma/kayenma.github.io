   <h1>How it Works!</h1>
   <div class="body">
      <p>This app allows users to quickly and easily find someone nearby who is interested in doing the same activity within 6 hours. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the app works:</p>
      <ol>
         <li>Upon opening the app, the user is prompted to enable their GPS location to identify where they are located.</li>
         <li>The app then gives the user a list of options to choose from such as drinking, bowling, or going to the cinema.</li>
         <li>Once the user selects the activity they want to do, the app prompts them to take a selfie to capture the moment.</li>
         <li>The user can also write a few words about the activity, but it's not required.</li>
         <li>The timer then starts for 6 hours, during which the selfie and activity information are available to other users nearby.</li>
         <li>After 6 hours, the selfie and activity information are deleted from the app.</li>
         <li>During the 6 hours, the user can wait to receive messages from people nearby to chat and meet.</li>
         <li>The user can also see who is nearby and what they like to do within the 6-hour timeframe.</li>
      </ol>
